# Clustering
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study applies clustering techniques to identify geographic and demographic patterns
in reported cases in the United States. We utilize available datasets, including the COVID-19 Cases Plus Census file, 
COVID-19 Cases TX, and the Global Mobility Report. Our analysis reveals distinct clustering patterns in Texas counties among
certain age and race groups with varying educational levels, income, and household properties. These patterns suggest the need for 
targeted interventions for disease control. The findings have important implications for public health strategies and resource 
allocation in future pandemics. This research enhances our understanding of the pandemic's spread dynamics and offers valuable 
insights for mitigating its impact.
